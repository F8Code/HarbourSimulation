This is a simple javaFX harbour simulation for practicing the use of concurrently running threads. <br />
This app uses mechanisms such as semaphores, flags and locks for thread action management. <br />
While the simulation is sound, there were some slips in the animation due to the short project deadline, so take it with a grain of salt and best focus on the output shown in the console. <br />
