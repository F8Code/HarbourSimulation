This is a simple javaFX harbour simulation for practicing concurrently running threads. <br />
This app uses mechanisms such as semaphores, flags and locks for thread action management. <br />
While the simulation is sound, there were some slips in the animation due to the short deadline, so take it with a grain of salt and rather look at the console output. <br />
